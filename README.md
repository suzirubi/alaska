##Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:

Create a site replica of [Arctic Wild](http://arcticwild.com/), a wilderness guiding company based in Alaska using flexbox and no floats (absolute/relative positioning used where appropriate). At minimum the page should be recreated down as far as the gallery. Your images must include hover effects using transform and/or transition. The page must also be responsive at at least one breakpoint. Assets do not need to be the same.
